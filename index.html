            When we think of Indian food, our minds are likely to travel to
            rich, fragrant curries and crisp snacks like pakoras or samosas. Yet
            India has a food culture rich with super sweet desserts. Gulab jamun
            is one of the most popular Indian sweets appearing at festivals,
            birthdays and weddings. While soft little dumplings soaked in syrup
            exist around the world, what sets gulab jamun apart is that the
            dumplings are made from milk. Traditionally, milk was simmered until
            only the solids remained, which were then mixed with maida flour to
            form little balls.
